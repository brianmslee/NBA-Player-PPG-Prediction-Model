# NBA-Player-PPG-Prediction-Model

## NBA player ppg prediction model based on NBA data from the 2021-2022 season's player statistics. I utilized Tensorflow neural network models each with different loss functions to try to build a model that can predict a playerâ€™s ppg for the dataset. The project consisted of statistical concepts such as observing correlation between features and target variables, linear regression model to check the coefficients of feature variables, observation of mean squared error, r squared, and p-values through ordinary least squares function for statistical significance.
